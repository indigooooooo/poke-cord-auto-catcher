1.3.2 Changelog
- Added Box, Item, Daily, Vote, Quest, Swap, Hunt, and Catchbot buttons.
- Right clicking on buttons with mouse icons give options to the respective button
- Added error codes, if there was a problem with the script, it should give you info instead of just not doing anything.

- Still looking into bug random ";p" commands after turning script on and off repeatedly
- Looking into script running in ANY tab that has the name "discord" instead of just running inside discord.

Auto Catcher for PokéMeow Discord bot

ONLY WORKS WITH WINDOWS AND 1080P DISPLAYS, COMPATIBLE WITH SINGLE AND DUAL-DISPLAY SETUPS ONLY. DISCORD MUST BE MAXIMIZED. YOU STILL NEED TO WATCH FOR THE CAPTCHA, AND THROW POKEBALLS MANUALLY

You do not need everything in the zip, just download the .exe if you want that.

Hit the Green Code Button, click "Download ZIP"
Extract the downloaded folder, go into the "dist" folder, and open PokéCordAutoCatcherx.x.exe
Thats it :)

Thank You Alex & Alex for testing <3
