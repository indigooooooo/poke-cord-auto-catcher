1.3.3 Changelog
- Added, and changed order of buttons in Egg menu
- Added Lootbox, and Battle buttons
- Changed Release Dupes button to say "Release" (personal choice, thought it looked weird in the button)
- Rearranged all buttons

- Still looking into bug random ";p" commands after turning script on and off repeatedly
- Still looking into script running in ANY tab that has the name "discord" instead of just running inside discord. (these bug fixes may not come until all intended features are added)

Auto Catcher for PokéMeow Discord bot

ONLY WORKS WITH WINDOWS AND 1080P DISPLAYS, COMPATIBLE WITH SINGLE AND DUAL-DISPLAY SETUPS ONLY. DISCORD MUST BE MAXIMIZED. YOU STILL NEED TO WATCH FOR THE CAPTCHA, AND THROW POKEBALLS MANUALLY

You do not need everything in the zip, just download the .exe if you want that.

Hit the Green Code Button, click "Download ZIP"
Extract the downloaded folder, go into the "dist" folder, and open PokéCordAutoCatcherx.x.exe
Thats it :)

Thank You Alex & Alex for testing <3
