1.3 Changelog
- Made it even MORE improbable to click anything else while the script is running
- ;p took a bit long to type after automouse would take affect, lowered delay.
- Aware of the script sometimes running twice after repeated start and stop of script, looking for a fix, just restart the application to fix.
